At this point I have built my fourth project for Flatiron School Online Software Engineering Program. This is a walkthrough of how I utilized DevTools to build and debug my program Quotivational — a motivational quotations storing web application.

The task at hand:
* Build a Single Page Application
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Backend: API built with Ruby on Rails

> This is a really exciting moment — the whole course up until this point is coming together! — Learn.co

My experience:

This project was really a test of my DOM manipulating and debugging skills using DevTools. Most of my time building Quotivational- motivational quotation storing application- was spent in the console and sources tabs through Google Chrome’s DevTools.
