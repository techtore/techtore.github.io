If you are preparing for, or in the middle of your React-Redux project for Flatiron School, then you’re in the right place. Below I will lay out some key tips to help you survive the many “WTF?” moments you will encounter this week.

1. ** Plan, plan plan.** This may seem like an obvious one, because you’ve probably had to plan out all of your projects up until this point. I highly recommend using something like (draw.io) https://app.diagrams.net/ to plan out EVERYTHING! I drew out my database tables, the design for each page that I wanted to render, and explicitly wrote out which components would be responsible for what. There were still probably more things I could have tried to plan, that would have been helpful along the way.

2. **Utilize your network.** This is especially NOT the time to be prideful, and NOT ask for help. Every project week up until this was preparing me for this. There is no shame in asking for help. No questions are stupid. ASK FOR HELP! Attend open office hours. Observe what problems others in your cohort are experiencing, and how they are being solved. Chances are, you will run into a similar problem. If you do, you know who specifically you can ask for help, or you will already know how to solve it.

3. **Dev tools are your best friend.** Learn how to use the react and redux chrome extensions so that you can see how your actions are dispatching, what’s in state, check for props, etc., etc. Remember how to use binding.pry and debugger from your previous projects?? You will see them again in this one. Use them!

4. **Take breaks.** This is huge! I wasn’t so great about taking breaks this time around. The truth is that your brain needs breaks. Try to do sprints rather than marathons. It can be easy to get into the zone and work until you are burnt out, but that’s not as productive. Plan breaks. Use a pomodoro timer if you have to. By this point in your program it is likely that you’ve built up your stamina and don’t have to take breaks as frequently, but take them.

5. **Develop a distancing routine (boundaries).** In the time of COVID-19 distancing is a familiar concept. I learned the importance of distancing myself from my project when I was feeling frustrated, really overwhelmed, or ready to give up. This was especially important for me in the evenings, and in my nightly routine. I designated a stopping time each night and I had to leave my project where it was until the next day. Otherwise, I would obsess over it and not get any sleep. Meditating and journaling at the end of my day is very helpful for me. I use the calm app on my phone every night as I’m falling asleep, to settle my mind and re-center myself.

6. **Listen to your mind and body.** This was the biggest challenge and most rewarding lesson I learned for this project. As I mentioned above, it is time of COVID-19. I came down with a virus, in the middle of project week. This messed up my energy levels, ability to think and retain information, and overall created very uncomfortable circumstances. As much as I wanted to push through and get my project done on time, my body wouldn’t let me. I pushed myself too hard, and paid the price. Guess what?! It wasn’t worth it. I overwhelmed my body and mind, and probably took time away from myself, when I should have been resting. All because I was worried about a timeline. This project should NOT come in the way of your health and well-being. Health and wellness are number 1 priority. I had to get over the mental block that I created, that my timeline for graduation being changed was the end of the world. It’s not. If I have to repeat this section, I’ll be okay. I might even be better off, who knows?

If you have read this far, I hope you were able to take away some valuable tips as you move toward the end of your time in Flatiron School. I wish you the best of luck finishing up your projects, assessments, and job interviews. There is light at the end of this tunnel. You have this!
