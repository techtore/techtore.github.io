If you’re like me, you’re probably finding yourself at a point in life where you’re looking for something more, or different. Many people come to coding bootcamps for a career change. I too, came to Flatiron School for a career change, or more of a career start. Despite getting both my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees, I hadn’t quite established myself in a career per-say. I more-so worked in roles where I felt my skills were needed at the time. That is until I started wanting more. I continued to find myself in positions where I felt like I wasn’t REALLY helping people to the capacity I knew that I could. Part of this of course is the fact that I was working in systems that weren’t designed to help the populations I was working with. I became frustrated by feeling like I was putting bandaids on people’s problems, and I wasn’t in a position to create real long-term sustainable solutions. It was then that I saw possibility elsewhere. This is where technology comes in. 

I had to start thinking bigger. This wasn’t something that came easily to me. Prior to deciding to attend bootcamp, I would never consider myself a dreamer. I always said that my husband is the dreamer and I’m the realist. So I had to channel my inner Kareem (my husband). I had to start thinking about what was possible, rather than what currently is. I had to stop limiting myself to what I know, and think about what I could learn. I had to think about what the systems could be, rather than what they are. I created a vision of my future in which I could create real solutions for communities in need. 

I had the dream, now it was time to figure out how to achieve it. I started exploring different paths in technology. This can seem overwhelming at first, because the possibilities are endless when it comes to pathways and careers in tech. Luckily, I had a husband who was already in tech so he was able to point me in the right direction. Here were my action steps:

* Look up different job titles and read job descriptions to see which ones are of interest to me.
* Read blog posts and watch youtube videos of people with those jobs to see what they do day to day, and what languages they work with.
* Sign up for codecademy(link) and work through different tracks based on research.
* Sign up for CareerKarma(link) to develop a network and guide my journey to break into tech.
* Find courses on Udemy, Udacity, and Coursera related to what I want to learn.

This was my process from January 2019-August 2019. From April 2019 - August 2019 I tried learning from online resources. I realized quickly that I needed a bit more structure and guidance. That is when I began looking into Coding Bootcamps. (It is totally possible to break into tech on your own, with online resources, but it didn’t work for me. ) 

I did a lot of research on bootcamps. If I couldn’t find answers to questions I had online, I sent out emails asking for more information. Through CareerKarma I reached out to people who were current or former students of the programs I was interested in, and asked them questions. I did the free prep-work that was available to get an idea of how the curriculum was set up to gain a better understanding of how learning would be throughout the program.

Things to consider when looking for a bootcamp:

* Available programs.
* Job placement statistics for the program you’re considering (not all programs release this info).
* Support provided during the program (education coach, instructors, cohort leads, study groups, lectures, slack channel).
* Job placement support provided.
* Where graduates are working (search Linkedin for school’s name to see alumni and where they work)
* Payment options.
* If there is a money-back guarantee program and what that entails.
* What the daily/weekly schedule looks like.
* What languages you’ll be learning.
* If there are any scholarships available and how to qualify.

Once I had the answers to these questions, I narrowed down my search to my top 3 and proceeded with the interview processes. Obviously, I decided to attend Flatiron school for many reasons. Once I accepted my offer to Flatiron School, the real fun began.
