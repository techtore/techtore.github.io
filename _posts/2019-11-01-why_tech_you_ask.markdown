The burning question. I've been asked many burning questions in my lifetime. The most recent one is, "Why tech?" There's a lot that goes behind that answer. 

Like many other mid-20 somethings, I was looking for a career change. That's funny, because I still haven't really established a career. I studied Social Work. I didn;t just study it, I Mastered it, in the sense of degrees. That didn't last long. My journey to finding my place in a career has been quite the rollercoaster. When I made the choice that I wasn't "cut out" for Social Work I was left lost. Or to be more accurate, unemployed. That's right folks, I quit my job without havig a backup. This left me jobless for 8 months, until the next best thing came around... Early Childhood Education. Did I say next "Best" thing?? That's laughable too. There were some great moments, if you don't count the times I was bit, hit, kicked, spit on, peed on, yelled at, etc. by a 2-year-old. Don't underestimate them. They can be terrifying. 

Let's fastforward to present day... (I won't go into the cross country move with my husband or the Charter School job). I am pursuing technology, because I still have a passion for Social Work. Deep down, I think I studied the right thing in school (I won't accept that my student loan payments are for 2 wasted degrees). It is my hope that I can utilize technology to break down systemic barriers to equity. Whether that's through increased access to Wifi and working computers; creating a program to get under/unemployed individuals into technology through skills training, resum√© building, interview training, etc.; or creating an app that helps those in need access resources, or helps priveleged people give back. Technology seems to be an avenue I can take to provide a better system for those who have been stuck in systems that continue to fail them. I may not have a clear understanding yet of how technology can create real solutions for real problems, but I know through the process I will learn.
